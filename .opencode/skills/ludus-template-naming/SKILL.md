# Ludus Template Naming

Apply one canonical grammar to Ludus Packer template directories, top-level
`.pkr.hcl` files, `vm_name` values, and exact consuming references. Preserve the
template's semantics; normalize only their representation.

## Canonical Grammar

Use lowercase ASCII letters, digits, hyphens, and dots only; never underscores.
Use hyphens between fields and within compound releases or multiword qualifiers.
Keep numeric release components dot-separated. Both basenames and final built
names must be DNS-compatible: each dot-separated label is 1–63 characters,
starts and ends with a letter or digit, and the full textual name is at most
253 characters without a trailing root dot. Include the built `-template`
suffix when checking these limits; it extends the final label.

| Family | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `<os>-<release>-<arch>-<role>[-<qualifier>...]-<locale>` |
| Windows client | `windows-<release>-<arch>[-<qualifier>...]-<locale>` |
| Windows Server | `windows-server-<release>-<arch>[-<qualifier>...]-<locale>` |
| Named FLARE environment | `flare-vm-<locale>` |

Accept `ubuntu`, `debian`, `kali`, `windows`, and `windows-server`. Use `x64`
or `arm64` for architecture. Require `desktop` or `server` as the Linux role.
Encode Windows Server's role in the family prefix and omit a separate role from
Windows client names.

Require a final lowercase two-letter locale token, including default `us`.
Treat that token as filename metadata only. Validate the physical keyboard,
XKB layout and variant, or Windows InputLocale independently.

Use dots for numeric releases such as `24.04.2`, `13.2`, and `2024.4`. Use a
hyphen when a release combines a numeric product release with a semantic
alphanumeric part, as in `11-22h2`. Use hyphens for multiword qualifiers,
as in `no-security-updates`. The architecture token ends the release; hyphens
alone do not distinguish separate qualifiers from words within one qualifier.

## Examples

```text
ubuntu-24.04.2-x64-desktop-no
debian-13.2-x64-server-no
kali-2024.4-x64-desktop-no
windows-11-22h2-x64-enterprise-no
windows-server-2019-x64-no-security-updates-us
windows-server-2019-x64-no-security-updates-no
flare-vm-no
flare-vm-us-template
```

Set the top-level `.pkr.hcl` basename equal to the directory basename. Set the
built template name to that basename plus exactly one `-template` suffix.

## Classification Workflow

1. Inspect the complete template directory, top-level `.pkr.hcl`, installer
   answer files, and exact consuming references before interpreting a legacy
   basename.
2. Classify an explicitly named environment before applying an OS-shaped grammar.
   Preserve `flare-vm-no` exactly, and recognize only `flare-vm-<locale>` plus
   its built `-template` form; do not expand FLARE into OS, release,
   architecture, edition, or feature fields.
3. For OS-shaped names, classify the OS family, release, architecture, Linux
   role when applicable, qualifiers, and locale from file content rather than
   token position. Add a qualifier only when the template provides direct
   evidence for it: retain `enterprise`, explicitly identified
   `no-security-updates`, and genuine `tpm` when a TPM device is configured.
   Never infer `tpm` from bypass registry commands, or harvest installer and
   provisioner settings as naming qualifiers.
4. Omit `tpm_bypas`, `tpm_bypass`, `standard`, `standard_evaluation`, and
   `desktop_experience` from names. These are not naming fields; do not change
   the underlying template settings while omitting them. Their hyphenated
   spellings (`tpm-bypas`, `tpm-bypass`, `standard-evaluation`, and
   `desktop-experience`) remain excluded too; never add `flare-vm` as an OS qualifier.
5. Ask one short question when evidence does not resolve a token. Never assume
   `no` means Norwegian; it can belong to `no-security-updates`, while the
   locale requires installer or other direct locale evidence.
6. Construct the basename with the family-specific shape and separators above.
7. Stop if the target directory or target `.pkr.hcl` already exists, including
   when a named-environment upgrade would collide with an unchanged identity
   name. Do not silently overwrite or merge into that target.
8. Rename the directory and top-level `.pkr.hcl`, set `vm_name`, and update
   exact old-name references. Do not blindly replace short tokens.
9. Search for the old full basename and inspect every remaining match.

Do not change locale, role, edition, feature, release, or architecture merely
to satisfy naming. Do not create backward-compatible aliases unless explicitly
requested.

## Validate Names

Resolve `scripts/validate_template_name.py` relative to this `SKILL.md`, not
relative to the caller's current working directory. Execute that resolved path
on both the basename and built name:

```bash
python3 /absolute/resolved/skill/path/scripts/validate_template_name.py \
  ubuntu-24.04.2-x64-desktop-no \
  ubuntu-24.04.2-x64-desktop-no-template
```

Interpret validator success as syntax validation only. Manually verify that
the final locale matches installer evidence, directory and `.pkr.hcl` basenames
match, `vm_name` is exact, and all consuming references were updated. The
validator never reads HCL, infers semantics, or renames files.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Put locale before Linux role | Put locale in the final field |
| Write `13-2` or `13_2` | Write numeric release `13.2` |
| Write `11_22h2` or `no_security_updates` | Write `11-22h2` or `no-security-updates` |
| Check only the basename's DNS length | Check the final `-template` name too |
| Omit default US locale | Append explicit `us` |
| Infer locale from `no` alone | Inspect installer keyboard configuration |
| Add `-template` to files | Add it only to the built `vm_name` |

## Completion Report

Report the old and new basenames, semantic field classification and evidence,
every renamed or edited file, updated references, validator results, and checks
that could not run.
